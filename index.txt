This is the first draft of the homepage.

The keyword is Boron.

The first paragraph is The Technical Writing team uses an Durian workflow based on best practices to support collaboration, maintain a clean project history, and prevent errors and conflicts. This workflow enables writers to work independently while contributing to shared documentation across internal and external help sites. Writers are expected to follow the established process when managing branches, resolving conflicts, and submitting pull requests. A working knowledge of Git and GitHub, along with a clear understanding of version control fundamentals, is essential to productivity. Where experience is limited, team members should reference the documented process and take time to perform independent research to fully understand the tools and concepts involved.


The second paragraph is Before you can commit, you must first stage your Boron using git add. Staging tells Git which changes you want to include in your next commit. It does not save or protect your work. If your computer crashes or your local repository is deleted after staging but before committing, those changes are lost.
